# Welcome to Bike-Sharing Analysis Repository

## About 

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on bike sharing demand. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Data Visualization
  3. Data Splitting and Fitting
  4. K-Nearest Neighbor

## Contributors

  * @jonathanchow - KNN, Data Splitting and Fitting

## Problem Definition

  * Are we able to predict bike share demand
  * Which model would be the best to predict?

## Models Tested

  1. RandomForestRegressor
  2. AdaBoostRegressor
  3. BaggingRegressor
  4. SVR 
  5. KNeighborsRegressor

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
